# Data Analyst Portfolio — Juan Antonio Mugica Liparoli

Welcome to my **Data Analyst** portfolio. Here you will find projects using
**Python, SQL, and Power BI** focused on **business analytics** (KPIs,
pricing, retention, time series) and **credit** (scoring, PD/LGD/EAD). I am
seeking **Data Analyst / Credit Analytics** roles.

## Tech Stack
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels), SQL (PostgreSQL/DuckDB),
Power BI, Git/GitHub, Jupyter/VS Code.

## Structure
- `projects/`: portfolio projects (each with its own README).
- `dashboards/`: Power BI reports and screenshots.
- `notebooks/`: EDA, feature engineering, and modeling.
- `sql/`: queries for KPIs, cohorts, retention.
- `src/`: reusable functions.
  
## Reproducibility
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
2
pre-commit install # optional but recommended
```
## Projects
1. **Data Cleaning + Sales KPIs** — ETL with Python, KPI definitions
(revenue, margin, ticket), and a BI dashboard.
2. **SQL Analytics** — Cohorts, retention, RFM, and segmentation using SQL
only.
3. **Power BI Visualization** — Sales & profitability with filters and
storytelling.
4. **Credit Scoring (Logistic Regression)** — Pipeline, metrics (ROC-AUC,
KS), interpretation (SHAP).
5. **Forecasting** — Time series (ARIMA/Prophet/Statsmodels) for demand or
revenue.
6. **A/B Testing** — Experimental design, p-values, power, multiple-testing
correction.
7. **Churn** — Early-warning signals and actions.
8. **End-to-End** — Mini pipeline: ingestion → features → model → report.
> Each project includes: the problem, data, steps, results, and business
lessons.
